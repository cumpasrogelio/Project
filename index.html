                        <br />Benguet, together with Abra, Apayao, Baguio City, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province 
                        comprise the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) in Northern Luzon. It has a mountainous terrain of peaks, 
                        ridges and canyons; and a temperate and generally pleasant climate.&nbsp;Benguet lies southernmost in the 
                        Cordillera Administrative Region. It is geographically located between 16'33'' north latitude and 120'34'' 
                        to 12'152'' east longitude. On the north, it is bounded by Mountain Proveince, on the south by Pnagasinan, 
                        on the east by ifugao and Nueva Viscaya and on the west by La Union and Ilocos Sur.&nbsp;The Province comprises 
                        one congressional district, two provincial board district, thirteen municipalities and one hundred forty 
                        barangays. It has three major etholinguistic groups: the Kankanaeys, Ibalois and Kalanguya and other minor 
                        groups with distinct cultures and histories on their own.<br /><br />
                        <strong>Early Settlement and Trade Movement</strong><br />
                        Long before the coming of the Spansh colonizer to the Philippines, the people of Benguet walked and lived
                        on the land, mountains and valleys of the southern Cordillera mountain range down to the sea coasts of
                        Ilocos Sur, Pangasinan and La Union to as far as the ancient trading centers of Ituy in the northern plains
                        of Luzon. There were no political subdivision or subjugation. Movements and settlements were in search of
                        rich hunting grounds, fertile valleys and the abundant resources of the earth, rivers and seas, and places
                        of barter and trade. Thus, the book &ldquo; A People's History of Benguet &rdquo; States: &ldquo; A
                        reconstruction of Benguet History, therefore, encompasses present-day Benguet and inclides the western
                        coastal provinces of Pangasinan, La Union and Ilocos Sur form Southern Lingayen Gulf to the outlet of
                        Amburayan river in the northern town of Tagudein. Remembrances of times past are tied to the river system
                        if fthe Agno, Angalacan-Bued,Aringay-Galiano, Naugilian and Amburayan, all in northwestern Luzon. The mossy
                        forest heights of the southern Cordillera mountain range constitute a natural east and southeast boundary.
                        <br />The Earliest known settlement as recounted in genealogical histories were the following town 
                        settlements: Chuyo and Tonglo in Baguio-Tuba: Darew and Playpay in Kapangan -Tublay: Imbose and Amlimay
                        in Kabayan-Buguias; and Namiligan and Palatang in Mankayan-Bakun. The gold and copper settlement working
                        sites were Pacutcutan, Acupan, Apaiao, Penas and Locjo all over Benguet.&nbsp;Centers of the barter and
                        trade between the highlanders and lowlander of the northern Luzon were at Ituy now known as Aritao in Nueva
                        Viscaya, Tagudin and Vigan in the Ilocos and Manaoag and Lingayen in Pangasinan. Benguet products such as
                        gold, cooper, iron, honey, beeswax were traded in exchange for lowland products such as salt, livestock,
                        cotton clothing or blanckets, and wares from foreign shores such as beads, plates and jars. Slaves form 
                        the highlands and lowlands were also items of trade.<br /><br />
                        <strong>How Benguet Got Its Name</strong><br />
                        The name Benguet was the first pronounced in La Trinindad, a thriving settlement at the crossroads to the
                        lowland trading sites during the period of Spanish expeditions. La Trinidad then was a settlement around a
                        lake alive with wildlife, wallowing carabaos dotted with patches of taro, rice, gabi and camote. In one
                        expedition, a curios Spanish conquistador who saw this settlement noted that people wore cloth covering
                        wrapped around their head several times. When he inquired about it, the native explained that the heavy head
                        covering which that people wore as protection from the searing cold and winds is termed &ldquo;benget&rdquo;.
                        With the western accent of colonizers &ldquo;benget&rdquo; was mispronounced as &ldquo;benguet&rdquo;.
                        In time, it eventually became a general reference to the territories of the Iggorotes peopled by the Ibaloi,
                        Kalangoya, Kankanaey and other minor tribes.<br /><br />

                                    <p>Japanese restaurant Chaya serves rich, authentic Japanese fare, from fresh tuna and salmon sashimi, to crisp vegetable and seafood tempura. But it is their homemade green tea ice cream – a small serving of which comes complimentary at the end of every meal – that really takes the cake. Served with red beans and, in the case of the Cream Anmitsu, a generous serving of fruits in season, the green tea ice cream makes for the perfectly refreshing cap to a classic Chaya meal.</p>

                                    <i>Balbacua</i> is a Southern Mindanao beef stew dish, slow-cooked for six hours and served with your choice of mountain rice or noodles. Factor in the place’s rustic, artsy ambiance and convenient location and you’ve got yourself your newest Baguio haunt.</p>

                                    <p>WORTH IT. Find out the reason behind the long lines with a serving of Canto’s Lomo Ribs.</p>
                                    <p>It’s easy to see why Canto, a restaurant at the Ketchup Food Community, is always full with diners (with more lining up outside): the lomo ribs, one of the few offerings on its menu, are just mouthwatering.

                                    Served with an excellent salad and either mashed potato or rice, it’s hard to believe half a slab goes for only P190. A whole slab – which can probably feed up to three people – is at P270.

                                    Head to Canto early for lunch to avoid lining up, especially on weekends. The restaurant is closed on Mondays.</p>

                                    Each serving goes for P110, and is available at the Hill Station restaurant along Upper Session Road (Casa Vallejo Building) and at the new Hill Station Bistro at the Camp John Hay Technohub.</p>

                                    <p>Call it a cake, pudding, or whatever — Chona’s Delight, a combination of moist chocolate cake, cream, and still more chocolate, is a piece of sweet heaven inside an unglamorous microwavable container.

For good measure, add liberal amounts of the restaurant’s signature chili sauce. Another no-fuss local joint, 456 also offers home-cooked Filipino food and beer.</p>

                                    Most notable of these is their signature Buttered Chicken – sweet and savory, with just the right amount of crispness, this is fried chicken done consistently well. Half a serving, which goes for P145, can feed up to 3 or 4 people.

                                    Good Taste’s newer branch along Cariño Street, near Burnham Park, is recommended for its larger seating capacity and parking availability.</p>

                                    <p>Burnham Park is a 32.84 hectare urban park located at the heart of the Baguio, in the Philippines. It was named after the American architect and urban planner, Daniel Hudson Burnham who laid the plans for the city. Several stretch of roads around the park lead to Camp John Hay, a former recreational base of the United States Armed Forces in the Philippines.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    At the southern part of the park, a skating rink was constructed. The Melvin Jones Grand Stand and Football Field at the eastern part of the park are normally used for several activities like parades, concerts, and political rallies. The Children's Park and the Orchidarium is located at the western part of the park. There are also bike rentals if one so wishes. You can rent either single bikes, tandem bikes or even bikes with side cars. They even have small bikes for the little kids of both two and three wheel versions.

                                    When the 1990 Luzon earthquake killed more than 100 people in Baguio, many homes were destroyed, leaving many displaced people seeking refuge in Burnham Park.</p>

                                    <p>Session Road is the main thoroughfare of Baguio in the Philippines and is the main hub of what is called the Baguio Central Business District. Located at the city center, it is actually divided into two parts: Lower Session Road and Upper Session Road.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Session Road derives its name from the fact that it used to lead up to the old Baden-Powell Hall, where the Philippine Commission held its sessions from April 22 to June 11, 1904 and officially initiated the use of Baguio as the Philippine Summer Capital. The Commission was composed of Governor General Luke E. Wright, president, and Commissioners Henry Ide, Dean Conant Worcester, T. Padre Tavera, Benito Legarda, Jose de Luzuriaga, James Francis Smith and William Cameron Forbes. A marker by what is now Baden-Powell Inn, right beside the enormous bus terminals on Governor Pack Road, stand as the only visible evidence that anything of historical significance ever took place on Session Road.

                                    Nowadays, the only session that regularly take place in the vicinity are the jam sessions at Ayuyang, a favorite watering hole of reggae, folk, and indigenous Filipino music fans and artists alike. A local Philippine band called sessiOnroad based their name on the famous thoroughfare.</p>

                                    <p>The Mansion House (also known as the The Mansion) is the official summer residence of the President of the Philippines. The mansion is located in the summer capital of the country, Baguio, situated around 5,000 feet (1,500 m) asl in the Cordillera Central Range of northern Luzon.<br /><br />
                                    The Mansion House consists of an elegantly designed Spanish Colonial Revival main building and a guest house. The elaborate main gate, made of ornate ironwork, was earlier reported as a replica of one of the main gates at Buckingham Palace in London, which is false. The front gate is still one of the most photographed section of the property. Tourists can visit the Mansion House's museum containing presidential memorabilia.

                                    Across the road from the Mansion House is Wright Park, a quiet promenade with a long reflecting pool lined with pine trees. A long stairway lead visitors to the back where ponies for children are available for hire. Dotted all around the nearby hills are vacation homes and small inns.

The development of the Agno River for purposes of hydroelectric power generation, flood control, and irrigation had been conceived as early as the late 1940s. Preliminary investigations for development at Ambuklao and Binga Dam sites were undertaken as early as January 1948. With maximum water storage capacity of 327,170,000 cubic metres (265,240 acre·ft), the facility, which is located 36 km (22 mi) from Baguio city, can produce up to 105 megawatts of electricity to Luzon grid. The main source of water comes from the Agno River which originates from Mt. Data.

                                    <p>The Fire Mummies of the Philippines, also known as the Kabayan Mummies, Benguet Mummies, or Ibaloi Mummies, are a group of mummies found along the mountain slopes of Kabayan, a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when Spain colonized the Philippines. Today, they remain in natural caves and a museum in Kabayan.<br /><br />
                                    Scientists believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the Ibaloi between 1200 and 1500 AD in five towns in Benguet and buried in caves. Others believe that the process of mummification began at 2000 BC. What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of mummification. That mummification began shortly after a person died, where he would digest a very salty drink. After his death, his corpse was washed and set over a fire in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. Smoke from tobacco was blown into the mouth to dry the body's inside and internal organs. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body. Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches. The practice of that mummification ended, since Spaniards colonized the Philippines in the 16th century.
